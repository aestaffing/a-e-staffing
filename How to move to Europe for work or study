At the beginning of 2020, I was stuck at home running my staffing business and arguing with immigration officers daily, trying to get workers over to Estonia. Obviously, I didn't have much luck as everyone was playing it safe because of covid-19.
This gave me a lot of time to think, and during this time I had a thought. How many people have I had to turn away for a job, people who were desperate to enter Estonia but due to a lack of jobs they couldnâ€™t get a job offer in advance? 
This gave me an idea, instead of just sourcing overseas staff for long-term positions. Why not look at assisting people with temporary job placements during their stay, allowing them to spend at least 12 months in Estonia either working with us, working remotely for someone else, or working in Estonia for another company.
This brought me to the focal point of this article. A placement service for foreigners to come to Estonia, travel around Europe, and either work or study during that period. We have a few ways of doing this, such as organizing study programs, signing you up for our temp agency, or getting you permission to stay as a remote worker.
Because of covid, there are some delays in processing times but we should be able to have you settled in at most 3 months. We charge a fee of roughly 1500 EUR to assist you, but only about half the fee is necessary upfront. With our program, you can stay from 1 year to getting citizenship. For those on a budget, we can also do the same thing for Montenegro, which should be an EU member by 2025 for about 1100 EUR.
Some packages have income requirements, in certain cases these are avoidable, but each case is different. For more info, please check out our website at www.workwithae.com and you could be living in Europe before you know it.
